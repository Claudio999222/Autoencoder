# Autoencoder Implementation on MNIST Dataset

## Overview

This notebook focuses on the implementation of an autoencoder, a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. The architecture of the autoencoder is designed to encode and then decode input data, aiming to reconstruct the original input as accurately as possible.

## Key Objectives:

1. **Autoencoder Architecture**: Define the structure of the autoencoder, including the encoder and decoder components.

2. **Training on MNIST Dataset**: Utilize the MNIST dataset for training the autoencoder. The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9).

3. **Encoder and Decoder Visualization**: Examine the representations created by the encoder and the reconstructed outputs generated by the decoder.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Explore evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) to assess the performance of the autoencoder.

5. **Application of Autoencoder**: Discuss potential applications of autoencoders, including data compression and denoising.

## Considerations:

- Autoencoders consist of an encoder network that compresses the input data and a decoder network that reconstructs the input from the compressed representation.
- The goal is to minimize the difference between the input and the reconstructed output during training.
- Autoencoders can be applied to various domains, such as image compression and feature learning.

This notebook provides a practical example of implementing an autoencoder using the MNIST dataset and explores its applications in data compression and representation learning.
